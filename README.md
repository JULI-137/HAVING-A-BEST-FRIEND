# HAVING-A-BEST-FRIEND

A story tells that two Friends👬 were walking through the desert🏜️. During some point of the journey they had an argument,and one friend slapped the other one in the face. 

The one who got slapped was hurt💔,but without saying anything, wrote in the sand;

"Today my best friend slapped me in the face"
